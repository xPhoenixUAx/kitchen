                  Custom kitchen projects typically range from $15,000 to
                  $65,000 depending on size, materials, and features. Small
                  kitchens (80-120 sq ft) start around $15,000-$25,000. Medium
                  kitchens (120-200 sq ft) average $25,000-$40,000. Large
                  kitchens (200+ sq ft) range from $40,000-$65,000+.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final cost depends on cabinet quantity, wood species, door
                  style, countertop material, hardware selections, and
                  organizational accessories. We provide detailed quotes with
                  transparent pricing so you know exactly what you're paying
                  for.

                  From your first consultation to project completion, most
                  kitchens take 6-8 weeks:

                <ul>
                  <li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Weeks 2-3:</strong> Design revisions and contract

                  This saves money by avoiding plumbing and electrical
                  relocation. However, if your current layout isn't functional,
                  we can redesign it to improve workflow and maximize space.

                  During the consultation, we'll discuss whether your current

                  <strong>Stained finishes:</strong> Show the natural wood grain
                  and character. Available in over 50 colors from light natural
                  to dark espresso. Best for showcasing beautiful wood species
                  like cherry, walnut, or oak. Slightly more expensive due to
                  higher-grade wood requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Painted finishes:</strong> Provide a smooth, uniform
                  color with no grain showing. Perfect for modern, traditional,
                  and farmhouse styles. Available in unlimited colors. Can hide
                  minor imperfections better than stain. Often more affordable
                  because paint-grade wood (like maple or MDF) can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both finishes are catalyzed for maximum durability and easy

                  Installation typically takes 3-5 days. During this time, your
                  kitchen will be partially usable. We ensure you have access to
                  running water and basic amenities each evening. However, you
                  won't be able to cook full meals, so plan for eating out,
                  ordering in, or using a microwave/hotplate in another room.

                  Many clients set up a temporary kitchen in their dining room
                  or garage with a microwave, coffee maker, and mini-fridge.
                  We're happy to discuss strategies to minimize disruption.
